We're recreating [Habitat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_(video_game)), the world's first MMO, using modern technology.  We'd love it if you joined us!

Play Habitat Now!
-----------------

We maintain a demo server running the latest Neohabitat code and you can connect to it at any time. There's often a few members of the regular crew hanging out there, so come say hey!

**Please note**: Neohabitat is currently in alpha, so there will likely be some instability. If you see anything weird, please [tell us about it in our Slack](http://slack.neohabitat.org/).

With all that out of the way, here's how to get started:

### Step 1 - Download and Install either the Windows or OSX Habitat package (which comes with VICE, the C64 emulator)

**Windows**

- Download [Neohabitat.zip](https://github.com/frandallfarmer/neohabitat-doc/blob/master/installers/Neohabitat.zip?raw=true)

- Unzip onto the desktop
	- This is not yet an installer. Want to help build one? Join us at http://slack.neohabitat.org
	
- Open the Neohabitat folder

- Double-click the **= Launch Habitat =** icon.
	
**OS X**

Download the [Neohabitat DMG](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssalevan/Neohabitat.dmg) then drag the Neohabitat application to the **Applications** folder.

The OS X application bundles all Habitat disks, so simply **launch the Neohabitat application** you dragged to **Applications**.

**Please Note**: OS X may inform you that this app comes from an unknown developer upon first launch. If this happens, **open System Preferences** and click **Security & Privacy**. From the following pane, click **Open Anyway** to launch the Neohabitat application.

### Step 2 - Login and play!

In a few moments, you'll be brought to the Neohabitat splash screen:

Major thanks to **Gary Lake-Schaal** who developed our custom loader and built the original Habitat client from the original 1985 source!

At this point, **Press Enter** then enter your username:

![Neohabitat Login](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssalevan/neohabitat/launcher_login.png)

**Press Enter again**, then wait until the Habitat client loads and asks you to insert your imagery disk:

At this point, **Press Alt-n or âŒ˜-n **, then **Press Enter**.

If all goes well, you'll materialize in downtown Populopolis:

### Step 3 - Learn How to Play

Welcome to Neohabitat! There's a whole lot you can do here and thousands of exotic places to visit.

To learn about all the things you can do, read the [official Habitat manual from 1988](https://frandallfarmer.github.io/neohabitat-doc/docs/Avatar%20Handbook.html).

You'll also need to hook up a joystick, whether it's physical or virtual. To set one up, **open the Settings menu** then select **Joystick**. Habitat expects a joystick in **port #1**.
