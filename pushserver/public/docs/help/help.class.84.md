*This device will let you choose the color and pattern of the things in your Turf*

While you are in your own turf and have the Change-o-matic in your hand, Point at wall or furniture, then select **DO** to cycle through colors and textures.

**NOTE:** You may see strange edge artifacts when putting certain colors on top of others. Blue, Black and Skintone textures can avoid these effects.

[See more details about Turfs in Chapter 4 of the Habitat Manual](https://frandallfarmer.github.io/neohabitat-doc/docs//Avatar%20Handbook.html#CHAP4)
