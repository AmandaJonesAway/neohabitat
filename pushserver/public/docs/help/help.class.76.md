# Tokens help

*The Habitat Token is a 23-sided plastic coin slightly larger than an American quarter, with a portrait of Vernor Vinge and the motto "Fiat Lucre" on its face, and the text "Good for one fare" on the back; these details are difficult to make out on the Commodore 64 screen.*

A token object holds multiple units of currency. All machines that have prices require you are hold enough tokens when you **DO** them for their effect. The machines will only take the correct amount, leaving you with the correct balance in your hand.

When you place tokens in a container they will merge with any other token object in that container (including your Avatar's pocket.)

**F7** while pointing at a token displays denomination.

**DO** while holding a token allows you to split it to a specific denomination (for example, if you want to give some tokens to another avatar.) Be sure to enter the amount in the *TALK* line. Any remainder will be put in back into your Avatar's pocket.

**NOTE:** *When using a vending machine, you will usually have tokens left in your hand - so you'll need to remember to put them in your pocket before you try to pick up anything you've purchased.*
