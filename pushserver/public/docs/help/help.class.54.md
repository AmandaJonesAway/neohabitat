# Paper help

*Finally, enough space to actually record something...*

This is a combination document/mail object.

Select **DO** to read from or write on the paper. Use the buttons at the base of the paper to Save/Erase/Reply, etc.
If the first line contains "TO: SOMEAVATARNAME" it will be delivered as Habitat mail to SOMEAVATARNAME's pocket.

No littering! If you drop an empty sheet of paper on the ground, it will vanish.
