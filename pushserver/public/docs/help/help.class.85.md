# Trivia

Every item in a vending machine can have a unique price to enable "local market efficiency" - and most items could be sold-back (at a markdown) in Pawn Machines (which originally used a fixed price list by object class.) During the original Habitat Beta test in 1986, this custom pricing lead to some interesting problems, recorded in  [The Lessons of Habitat](http://www.fudco.com/chip/lessons.html) scroll to "A Warning."
