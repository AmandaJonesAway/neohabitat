# Head help

*Mom always told me to get a head in life, but I don't think this is what she meant.*

You can change your avatar's head in Habitat.

Empty your hands before wearing or removing a head.

* To remove your head, select **GET** while pointing at it (not your body.)
* To wear the head you are currently holding, **PUT** while pointing at your body.

[For more about heads and other ways to customize your avatar, see Chapter 2 of the Habitat Manual](https://frandallfarmer.github.io/neohabitat-doc/docs//Avatar%20Handbook.html#CHAP2)
