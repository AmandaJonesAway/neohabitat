# Avatar help

*Avatars are the creatures of this world - all controlled by outside forces, either people in the Human Realm (including you!), or artificial intelligences in service of the Oracle.*

Your Avatars understands and responds to six basic commands: **GO**, **DO**, **GET**, **PUT**, **TALK** (typing) and **HELP** (F7).

**GO** moves your body near the object or place that you point. If you point to the edge of the screen, you will try to walk off that edge to the next region. If you point to yourself, you will sit down.

**DO** activates the object you are pointing at - that may involve interacting with the object in your hand. If you are pointing at yourself, it will activate the obeject in hand

**GET** will attempt to pick up (or take from) the object you're pointing at, including your own pocket.

**PUT** place the item you're holding on/in the indicated object.

**TALK** commands are things you type. Most of the time, you typing is simply displayed in a word-balloon for everyone in the region to see. Some objects will reply. If you want to send a personal message to another user you can send **ESP** by typing "To: UserName" at the start of the line and press enter to start sending private messages.

**HELP** Pressing **F7** while pointing at an object will bring up contextual help, like this. 


## Matters of Posture

There are certain body movements you can control, such as standing up and sitting down. Point the cursor at your Avatar and press the button. Choose GO and watch him cycle his body posture among the available positions. You can also make gestures by pressing the *gesture keys*. These are the CTRL-digit keys (hold the CTRL key down while pressing one of the digits 0 through 9).


Pressing | makes your avatar
