# Box help

*Hey! This box bigger on the inside!*

This box holds up to 10 items.

When standing next to this container, **DO** while pointing at it to *open* or *close* it.

When this container is *open* you can **GET** things out of it, and **PUT** things into it.

When it is *closed*, use **GET** it to pick it up and **PUT** it like any other object.

Some containers require keys to (un)lock or open.
