# Teleport Booth help

*This booth is a bit cramped, and makes a soft whirring sound. You see a slot that says "Insert 10T".*

Requires 10 tokens, so you must first **GET** tokens out of your pocket and then point at the teleport booth and **PUT** them in.  Upon inserting a token you should hear a brief sound indicating that the teleport is activated. 

Make sure your avatar is still inside the teleport and that your cursor is placed on the teleport itself before proceeding.

**TALK** (type) the address of a destination teleport, and press **RETURN/ENTER**.

To go to your private *Turf* (where your avatar lives), enter **HOME**

Some destinations to try:
* **42nd**
* **Plaza**
* **Downtown**
* **Uptown**

Many town teleports have a directory attached - if you see a plaque near this teleport, select **DO** to read it for some more help and destinations.
