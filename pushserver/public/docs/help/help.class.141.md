# Fountain help

*Phrase your question or request* carefully!

**TALK** (type a message) while pointing at the fountain sends message to the Oracle. 

# The Fountain

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frandallfarmer/neohabitat-doc/master/docs/images/fount.png "The Oracle")

The fountain was a way for Avatars to talk to "The Oracle," or the modern day equivalent of an admin. The Oracle would manifest itself as a fountain, magic lamp, or even a crystal ball!

I was the first Oracle/Operator. (I talk about that experience in Geek Gods Revisited). The operator's job is most important. It really is like being a Greek God from the ancient writings. The Oracle grants wishes and introduces new items/rules into the world. With one bold stroke of the keyboard, the operator can create/eliminate bank accounts, entire city blocks, or the family business. This is a difficult task as one must consider the repercussions of any "external" effects to the world. Think about this: Would you be mad at "God" if one day suddenly electricity didn't work anymore? Habitat IS a world. As such, someone should run it that has experience in that area. I suggest at least 10 years experience in Fantasy Role Playing and 2 years on telecommunications networks (specifically ones with CHAT programs). A Geek God must understand both consistency in fictional worlds, and the people who inhabit it.

To optimize the Habitat funativity experience, the goal is to move the user from his/her present category to the next one up:

Passive->Active->Motivator->Caretaker->Geek God.

Move everyone one role to the right, and you will have a successful, self maintaining system. (Read: you will make bags of money.)

# The Oracle Factor
There is one pervasive factor in every Avatar’s life: the Oracle, the great, all-knowing, mysterious power residing in Habitat. No one knows where It came from — but then again, no one really cares.

What Avatars do care about is the fun, intrigue and adventure that the Oracle provides. In return, they support It with donations.

The Oracle grants wishes, sends Avatars on quests and adventures, and has been known to play a trick or two.

The Oracle takes on many forms and appears in many places. It commonly manifests Itself as the fountain found in the center of most Habitat towns. However, there are other places where it appears, and they are not all the same. In particular, the Oracle likes to encourage travel and exploration by making you journey to exotic and distant places before It will answer some questions or grant certain requests.


# Dates to Remember
>At first, there was only the Oracle. Tired of playing solitaire and having the world all to Itself, the Oracle created Avatars for Its amusement. All time in Habitat dates from the creation of Avatars, the Oracle referring to the time before them as ‘‘The Great Boredom.’’

###  0 A.C. (After Creation)
The Great Boredom ends as the Oracle creates Avatars.
###  765 A.C.
The Oracle hands down The National Leisure Edict, providing for ‘‘life, liberty and the pursuit of quality leisure time’’ for all Avatars. Each Avatar is granted a trust fund from the Oracle, removing the need to work for a living.
