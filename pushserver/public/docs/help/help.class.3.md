# Ghost help

*Ghosts bypass traffic jams, and danger by abandoning Avatar form...*

Avatars can turn themselves into *ghosts*. When an Avatar is a ghost, he can’t affect the world in any way, though he can move around and see what is happening wherever he may be. Ghosts are an exception to the so-called *five guests only* rule, which states that no more than six Avatars may gather in one place at a time. Any number of ghosts (well, a very large number anyway) can occupy the same place at the same time. Turning yourself into a ghost is the preferred way of bypassing traffic jams in crowded areas. Becoming a ghost is also the way you join the audience in a theater or night club.

To turn your Avatar into a ghost, press the **F1** key. Your Avatar’s body will disappear. To turn back into an Avatar, simply press **F1** again. Your body will be restored to its previous condition. If you are a ghost, or if there are any ghosts in a region with you, you will see the *ghost-icon*, an Egyptian Eye-Of-Horus hieroglyph, displayed in the upper left-hand corner of the screen.

To attend a play or lecture or other mass entertainment, turn yourself into a ghost before entering the theater. To get through an over-crowded section of the world, turn yourself into a ghost and move about as if the crowd wasn’t there. When you reach an uncrowded place, you can turn yourself back into a regular Avatar. You won’t be able to turn back into an Avatar if it is too crowded when you try to do so (you will simply hear a soft *BOING* sound instead). You will just have to move to a less crowded place or wait for somebody else to leave.
