# Elevator help

*You hear soft, soothing music as you hear a quiet voice ask "Choose a floor..."*

The elevator works a lot like the teleporter. Place your cursor over the  elevator and perform a **GO** command, then **TALK** (type) the floor number and press **RETURN/ENTER**.

If you want to go to the 4th floor then type in the number '4' and press RETURN. To go back to the lobby with the elevator, just type in 'lobby' and you'll be sent back.

The placement of your avatar inside the elevator is important. Make sure your cursor is still located on the elevator when you **TALK** the floor number.
