*Beep. Boop. ZZZiing*

Use this ATM to access your bank account - a safe place to store your tokens.

**DO** will display your account balance.

**GET** while empty handed will allow you to withdraw tokens. After selecting **GET** you will be prompted for an amount. After you get them, remember to **PUT** them in your pocket.

**PUT** will deposit any tokens you are holding into your account (and leave you empty-handed.)
