Welcome to (Neo)Habitat!
--------------------------

The screen with your Avatar represents one of thousands of different *Regions* in habitat. 

## Having trouble moving around?

You'll use a joystick (or the number pad) to move around and interact with the objects in the world.

## Joystick 
To order your avatar to move around press the button and push the controller in the directions indicated here to select the command, then release the button.

Try moving the cursor around on the screen. Move the cursor around to get the initial feel for the controls.  

For our next step, point your cursor at the ground, but make sure it's slightly away from your Avatar.

![Prompt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frandallfarmer/neohabitat-doc/master/docs/images/prompt.png "Prompt")

Now, press the trigger button. You should now be seeing the icon above.

![GO](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frandallfarmer/neohabitat-doc/master/docs/images/go.png "**GO** command") 

While holding down the trigger press the stick upward to perform a **GO** command.

Then release the trigger and your Avatar should start to walk. If you hear a beep sound, that indicates your Avatar cannot walk to that location or something is in the way.

All the commands work this way, except talking (which is just typing, then pressing **RETURN/ENTER**)
                
### Walking To Different Regions (rooms)
To move to a new region, point your cursor towards the **very edge** of the screen and perform a **GO** command.

### Grabbing Objects ![GET](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frandallfarmer/neohabitat-doc/master/docs/images/get.png "**GET** command")  
To grab something, move your cursor over the object. And select the **GET** (stick right) command. 

Release the trigger and you should see your Avatar attempt to pick up an object. NOTE: For certain objects you may have to perform a **GO** command on them and then use **GET**.

### Putting Down Objects ![PUT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frandallfarmer/neohabitat-doc/master/docs/images/put.png "**PUT** command")
To put down an object that's in your Avatar's hand, move your cursor to where you would like to place the object. Press the trigger, and select **PUT** (stick left). 

### Interacting with Objects ![DO](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frandallfarmer/neohabitat-doc/master/docs/images/do.png "**DO** command") 
To interact with an object you must place your cursor over it. This applies to objects in your Avatar's hand and those on the ground. Now, Press the trigger, and select **DO** (stick up) to activate the object. 

## No joystick? Using the number pad instead:

You may have your controls mapped to the number pad. You can change and configure these controls in the emulator.

                  UP  
                  8
                  |
        LEFT 4 --   -- 6 RIGHT
                  |
                  2
                 DOWN  
                 
Hold down numpad-0 to simulate the joystick trigger. While that is down, select one of the numbers above, release the 0 to select the command in that direction.
