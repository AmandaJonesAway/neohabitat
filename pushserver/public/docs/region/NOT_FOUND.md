A Pretty _Chill_ Habitat Region
-------------------------------

Oh dang, looks like you're in a Habitat region! Try to explore around and socialize with other Avatars.

# Having trouble moving around?
By default, your controls are mapped to the numpad. You can change and configure these controls in the emulator.

                  UP  
                  8
                  |
        LEFT 4 --   -- 6 RIGHT
                  |
                  2
                 DOWN  

Try moving the cursor around on the screen. Move the cursor around to get the initial feel for the controls.  

For our next step, point your cursor at the ground, but make sure it's slightly away from your Avatar.

Now, hold down '0' on your numpad. You should now be seeing this icon on your screen:  
![Prompt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frandallfarmer/neohabitat-doc/master/docs/images/prompt.png "Prompt")

While holding down '0' on the numpad, press '8' to perform a "GO" command. A "GO" command looks like this:  
![GO](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frandallfarmer/neohabitat-doc/master/docs/images/go.png "GO command")

Then release your hand from the numpad and your Avatar should start to walk. If you hear a beep sound, that indicates your Avatar cannot walk to that location or something is in the way.

# Walking To Different Areas
To move to a new area, point your cursor towards the very end of the screen and perform a "GO" command.

# Grabbing Objects
Now that you understand the basic controls for Habitat then grabbing should be very straightforward.  

To grab something, move your cursor over the object. While holding down '0' on your numpad, press "6" to perform a "GET" command. Your icon should look like this:  
![GET](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frandallfarmer/neohabitat-doc/master/docs/images/get.png "GET command")  

Release your hand from the numpad and you should see your Avatar attempt to pick up an object. NOTE: For certain objects you may have to perform a "GO" command on them and then use "GET."

# Putting Down Objects
To put down an object that's in your Avatar's hand, move your cursor to where you would like to place the object. Now, hold down '0' on your numpad and press '6.' Your icon should look like this:  
![PUT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frandallfarmer/neohabitat-doc/master/docs/images/put.png "PUT command")  

# Interacting with Objects
To interact with an object you must place your cursor over it. This applies to objects in your Avatar's hand and those on the ground. Now, hold down '0' on your numpad and then press '4' to activate the object. Your icon should now look like this:  
![DO](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frandallfarmer/neohabitat-doc/master/docs/images/do.png "DO command")
