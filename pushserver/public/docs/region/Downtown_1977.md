# The Weekly Rant

This is the home of Habitat's most beloved newspaper, "The Weekly Rant." The Rant, as most people call it was an entirely user-run tabloid containing all the latest news, events, and rumors. For most Avatars, The Rant was one of Habitat's greatest strengths and represented one of the best aspects that online multiplayer gaming has to offer.

By far the Caretaker who had the greatest on his fellow users was the editor of the Habitat newspaper The Weekly Rant. This user tirelessly spent 20-40 hours a week (free account) composing a 20, 30, 40 or even 50 page tabloid with containing the latest news, events, rumors, and even fictional articles. This was no small feat, he had only the barbaric Habitat paper editor, and no other tools. After he had composed the pages of an issue, he would arrange them in several chests of drawers in The Rant office and send me mail. I would publish it by using a special host program that would bind them into a book object and distribute it to the news vendroids, check the copy by hand for errors, and deliver a copy to the office (in Habitat). This worked great, but took massive amounts of his personal time. I began to automate the process further just as Habitat operation changed hands. The new publisher didn't publish on time, delayed getting the tools ready to speed up creation, made editorial changes (he wanted it to be shorter, less fiction), and didn't hand-deliver a copy of the final product. The editor quit. Just like real life: Someone new runs the show and the sensitive leave. Again, these people are rare and should be handled carefully. The Rant will never be the same.
