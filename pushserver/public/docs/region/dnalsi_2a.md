# D'nalsi Island

D'nalsi Island was where the first quest in an MMO was held. The quest was a large scale treasure hunt which that took countless hours to design and setup. Eventually, many of the lessons learned from this event was carried over into modern MMO's.

The first treasure-hunt ever planned for Habitat was mine, the D'nalsi Island Adventure. I took me hours to design, weeks to build (including a 100-region island), and days to coordinate the actors involved. I had taken several guesses as to what how long it would take the players to perform each "segment" of the quest. The mission: recover the lost "Amulet of Salesh". First: A trial, introducing the characters and the first clues. Second: Salesh hires the adventurers. Third: The players needed to figure out the "secret" teleport address. Fourth, they must find the door to the hidden cave, solve the riddle. Last: find the hidden crawlway and the buried chest containing the amulet. The prize was 25,000t.

The first part was in the form of a "dinner theater"-like play, set in the county courthouse. It was heavily attended. Since it was set up as an introduction, there was no appropriate "time" for the players to discover anything.

On the day that Salesh "hired" adventurers to find his amulet, he gave out copies of a map of the island. Hidden on this map was a word that was the teleport address to the island. After about 15 minutes of hiring, when about the tenth Avatar was hired, Salesh (me) received an ESP from one of the Motivators: He had discovered the teleport address. Darn! It seemed that the others had no idea where to start, so I sent ESP to all the players announcing that the teleport address had been discovered to be a word on the map.

Within 8 hours the treasure had been recovered by that person who had first discovered the island. This was so soon that almost half the adventurers (the novices) had not yet even discovered the teleport address! It was clear that there is a very wide range of "adventuring" skills in the Habitat audience, and various events need to be better targeted, and should include handicapping mechanisms so that those behind don't get more and more behind.
