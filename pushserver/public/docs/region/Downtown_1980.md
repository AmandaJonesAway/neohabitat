# The Order of The Holy Walnut


According to ancient texts, the first virtual church was founded here in 1986. Followers of this sacred order preached the act of non-violence and peace within Habitat. The Order of The Holy Walnut still exists today and continues to preach about the act of non-violence, still following the same rules and mantra as it once did in 1986.

One of the outstanding proponents of the anti-violence-in-Habitat view was also the first Habitat Minister.

A Greek Orthodox Minister opened the first church in Habitat. His canons forbid his disciples to carry weapons, steal, or participate in violence of any kind. It was unfortunate that I had to eventually put a lock on the Church's front door because every time he decorated (with flowers), someone would steal and pawn them while he was not logged in!

# Wedded Bliss?


The first virtual marriage also took place on these very steps. While it was a joyous occasion for all to behold it unfortunately didn't last very long. Soon enough, Habitat became known for also having the first virtual divorce.

Three Habitat weddings took place in that church. These were not human-human weddings, but Avatar-Avatar. Their turfs were joined so that they could cohabit. There were some technical problems with this that should be resolved in any new versions. Only one account could enter a turf if the owner were not home. We hadn't properly handled cohabitation.

The first Habitat divorce occurred 2 weeks after the third wedding. I guess Habitat is a bit too close to the real world for my taste! The first habitat lawyers handled the divorce, including public postings all about town.
