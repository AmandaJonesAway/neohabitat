# The Vaultkeeper

Not much is known about The Vaultkeeper other than it was part of a quest that was run in the original Habitat world.

The first time you interact with it, you are given a key which would be used to unlock a door elsewhere.

You can view video footage of the original Vaultkeeper in action from the Summer of 1988 by Keith Elkin by clicking [here](https://youtu.be/KTtIzLZGNLw?t=3816)
