# Death Awaits Thee!

Beware of those who roam these lands! Be sharp, be quick, and be very afraid. You are no longer safe in these parts. Avatars can hurt and even _kill_ one another. You have been warned.

"Conflict is the essence of drama". We used this quote in the initial Habitat design document. Habitat (it was then named "Microcosm") was to have personal combat in the forms of weapons. Most computer games had combat, and we were offering a chance for users to effect each other!

Here I will explain how it actually ended up working. There were ranged weapons and hand-to-hand. An Avatar is born with 255 hit points (the actual number is masked from the user, and a "general state of health" message gives the user some idea how bad off he is.) While holding the weapon, you select a target and DO (attack). There is a telecommunications delay that may effect the hit-or-miss result. Each successful attack does some small amount of damage (i.e. 20 points.). You are always informed when you are shot, as your Avatar is knocked onto his rump.

As you can see, it would take quite a few hits to "kill" a healthy Avatar. Not only that, but you can avoid being damaged if the attacker can't "touch" you in 2 ways: 1) by turning into a ghost or 2) running around (not standing still). You use #2 when you are in a gunfight where you are shooting back. This seems to be a working dynamic. If you really, really are low on hit points, you travel the "wild" regions as a ghost. There are also devices that will restore your hit points. The real problem is communicating this to new users, who are often standing around in a region when a bandit comes along with a gun. The neophyte hears a "bang" and sees his Avatar knocked on his can. Instead of acting, he types a message like "What was that? Why am I sitting down?". Meanwhile, the bandit cranks out another 12 bullets.... Dead beginner probably had all of his money and stuff in his pocket too! This problem should be corrected in the Avatar Handbook, explaining that guns are dangerous (something we thought people would assume on their own).
