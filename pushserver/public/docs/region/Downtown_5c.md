The Vendroid was an automated machine which sold multiple items at varying prices. Aside receiving prizes and gifts, Vendroids served as the primary way of buying and obtaining new items. Also, much like the Pawn Machine, the Vendroid played a big role in
[The Big-Money Scam](https://www.crockford.com/ec/anecdotes.html#scam).

You are "hatched" with 2000t, and every day you log in, you receive 100t. Money can be won in contests/quests. You can buy and sell objects using automated machinery. The Vendroid sells stuff. The Pawn Machines buy it back. Each Vendroid makes the purchased item out of thin air. That's right, no production costs. This leads to an interesting problem of runaway inflation. We never got enough people in the system to understand this effect, but got a taste of in when "The Big-Money Scam" happened:
