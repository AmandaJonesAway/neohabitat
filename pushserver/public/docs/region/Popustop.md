# Populopolis

Populopolis is Habitat’s first city. It is named "Populopolis" because of its immense size (it’s as small as cities in Habitat come).

A real surprise was the popularity of the "Grand Opening". This the ribbon-cutting event when new regions were added to the world. Tokens and prizes were often hidden in the new regions, but it seems that the audience (especially the Passives) had an insatiable hunger to see new places and things. The Grand Opening of the Popustop Arms apartment building was the most heavily attended event of the Pilot test.
