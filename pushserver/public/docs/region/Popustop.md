# Populopolis

Populopolis is Habitat’s first city. It is named "Populopolis" because of its immense size (it’s as small as cities in Habitat come).

# Are You Lost?
If you're in an area that looks similar to the picture below then you are inside the Popustop apartment building. ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frandallfarmer/neohabitat-doc/master/docs/images/apartments.JPG "Apartment")  


# Which Floor Am I On?
The first thing that you need to do is look at the doors. Each door is assigned a number and these numbers are the key to finding your way out.  

What does a door labelled as #101 mean? The first digit represents the floor number. While the last two digits represent the apartment number.  

(So, a door labelled #205 would mean that it's the fifth apartment located on the second floor)

Now that you know which floor you're then on all you need is the direction of where to go. Once again, the numbers on the doors are important for this too.

# Follow The Doors
To get out of the apartment you'll want to reach an area that looks like this:

If you see a door within one of these ranges then keep going in the specified direction until you reach the area pictured above.

**200-211**
KEEP GOING RIGHT

**212-223**
KEEP GOING RIGHT

**224-235**
KEEP GOING LEFT

# Almost There
Now that you've reached the area in the picture, move your cursor all the way down where it says **EXIT**. Now perform a GO command. You should now be in an area that looks like this:  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frandallfarmer/neohabitat-doc/master/docs/images/popustopelevator.JPG "Elevator")

Notice that the cursor is placed right on top of the elevator. Now, perform a GO command on the elevator and your Avatar should walk inside of it. Once your Avatar is inside the elevator type **lobby** and hit **Enter**.

You should now be in the lobby. All you need to do is place your cursor towards the bottom of the screen where it says **EXIT** and perform a GO command.

**Congratulations!**

You finally made it out! Now get out there and explore. Also, make sure to remember that pressing F7 will give you helpful information about an object.

A real surprise was the popularity of the "Grand Opening". This the ribbon-cutting event when new regions were added to the world. Tokens and prizes were often hidden in the new regions, but it seems that the audience (especially the Passives) had an insatiable hunger to see new places and things. The Grand Opening of the Popustop Arms apartment building was the most heavily attended event of the Pilot test.
