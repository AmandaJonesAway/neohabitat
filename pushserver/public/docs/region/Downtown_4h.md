# Meeting Hall

The Meeting Hall was a place where Avatars could publicly debate and discuss important issues regarding the town of Populopolis. Avatars would hold elections for government position, create new laws, and define what constitutes a crime in Habitat.

Our design directive was not to interfere in Habitat politics or set up a government or law establishment. Many people thought that crimes of killing and theft ought to be punished. We decided to hold sheriff elections. The favorite candidate was a friendly guy, but many didn't know that this very same Avatar was the brains behind The Scam. There was a public debate in the Populopolis Meeting Hall with the 3 AvaCandidates making statements and fielding questions. I was among the ghosted attendees. I would pre-type some comment like "Vote for Foon!", de-ghost quickly, press return to send my message, and become a ghost again. No one would have any time to tell who I was before I was gone. This was fun. During the Question and answer period I, before appearing, typed this question: "Please explain to us why we should vote for a sheriff who obtained his campaign fees rather -ah- UNUSUALLY?". This started a real-life-like mud slinging fight. As it turns out, he won by a landslide anyway. Populopolis had a sheriff.

For weeks he was nothing but a figurehead. We were stumped about what powers to give him. Should we give him the right to shoot anyone anywhere? Give him a more powerful gun? A wand to >zap< people to jail? What about courts? Lawyers? Laws? Late in the test the answer struck me: ask the users! A "Committee for a Safer Habitat" sent out a mailer to everyone asking this question: "What should the sheriff be able to do?". Then another election was held "What is a crime?" and "What should the sheriff be empowered to do?". The results were unable to be acted on before the test ended. An interesting side effect of this was that it became apparent there are two basic camps: anarchy and government. It will be great to see what happens with thousands of users facing this decision. Habitat need not be set up with a "default" government (like reality).

# Dial H for Murder
Life and death play a huge role in Habitat, yet one of the most hotly contested issues in Habitat was _murder_. The act of murder posed an ethical dilemma for Avatars. Should a murderer be punished for their crime? Or should it be accepted since it's a feature of the game?

The hottest issue was, by far, murder. In Habitat, if an Avatar is "killed" he is teleported back home, with his pocket emptied, what he was holding dropped, his hit-points restored, and his head put in his hand. However, only what he had with him and his position in the universe has changed. One of the Motivators took to randomly shooting people roaming outside of town. A debate arose: Is Habi-Murder a crime? Should all weapons be banned? Is it all "just a game"? There was such a debate on the issue, that a vote was taken. We were surprised by the results. 50% said "A crime" and 50% said "no -- it is part of the fun". Our outlaw had in fact demonstrated that human-human interactive combat was fun for over half the audience. And since anyone who didn't want to fight could just "ghost" and run away, there was no reason to consider the banning of weapons.
