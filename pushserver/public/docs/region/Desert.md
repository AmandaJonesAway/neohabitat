# The Desert

Welcome to the Desert! Avatars that have weak hearts or get disoriented easily should not enter without proper equipment. No known maps exist and the F7 button won't guide you back to the city. **ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK**.

If you do get stuck, type in **/o** and a message to request help from an Oracle if one is online. If one isn't available, press F3 to see who is online. You can ESP this avatar and ask if they would send you a teleport request to pull you out of here!

The Really Quite Confusing Desert is a maze puzzle. It consists of 30 regions connected together in a bizarre and confusing manner, forming a maze that is easy to get into and difficult to get out of. In the very center of the Desert is a TelePort booth, which is the obvious shortcut for getting to the middle. Also in the middle is a vending machine selling rare and exotic artifacts, as a reward for those who successfully navigate the maze.
