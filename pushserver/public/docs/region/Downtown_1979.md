# The Order of The Holy Walnut


According to ancient texts, the first virtual church was founded here in 1986. Followers of this sacred order preached the act of non-violence and peace within Habitat. The Order of The Holy Walnut still exists today and continues to preach about the act of non-violence, still following the same rules and mantra as it once did in 1986.

One of the outstanding proponents of the anti-violence-in-Habitat view was also the first Habitat Minister.

A Greek Orthodox Minister opened the first church in Habitat. His canons forbid his disciples to carry weapons, steal, or participate in violence of any kind. It was unfortunate that I had to eventually put a lock on the Church's front door because every time he decorated (with flowers), someone would steal and pawn them while he was not logged in!

# Wedded Bliss?


The first virtual marriage also took place on these very steps. While it was a joyous occasion for all to behold it unfortunately didn't last very long. Soon enough, Habitat became known for also having the first virtual divorce.

Three Habitat weddings took place in that church. These were not human-human weddings, but Avatar-Avatar. Their turfs were joined so that they could cohabit. There were some technical problems with this that should be resolved in any new versions. Only one account could enter a turf if the owner were not home. We hadn't properly handled cohabitation.

The first Habitat divorce occurred 2 weeks after the third wedding. I guess Habitat is a bit too close to the real world for my taste! The first habitat lawyers handled the divorce, including public postings all about town.

# Trivia #1
The original name for this region was "Greg P:Priest". It was always known as The Order of The Holy Walnut but the region name didn't reflect this.

# Trivia #2

The inworld name of the priest was Greg P and he was an actual Priest in the real world, as well as a social worker and a psychotherapist. He was staunchly against weapons being available in Habitat and having the killers names being proudly displayed in the Hall of Records.

This further sparked a major debate about the entire situation which you can read about [here](https://github.com/Museum-of-Art-and-Digital-Entertainment/habitat/blob/master/chip/habitat/docs/worldgen/mayhem).

Below is a message he shared on the Quantum Link message boards regarding the matter.

**SUBJ:** Violence and Rewards
**FROM:** Greg P
**DATE:** 09/17/87

As a Priest, Social Worker, Psychotherapist, and member of the human race. I
am deeply concerned about Habitat's apparent lack of ethics.

It is deplorable that a game would REWARD you for KILLING and/or STEALING from
another person. Aren't Avatars supposed to be extensions of ourselves?

How is this done?

By posting the guilty Avatar's name in the Hall of Records and by the fact
that weapons are READILY available in almost all of the "Vendroids".

I **formally** protest this.

I was of the opinion that Habitat was to have been an alternative to violence
in computer games by giving the person a constructive challenge or adventure.

As a Priest and a person of ethics, I can not condone this "reward for
violence."

Please remove the "Killing Lists".

Please remove **all** weapons or means of violence.

Children learn by what they do. As it stands, Habitat will teach them that
killing/violence is good, fun, and you can be rewarded for it as well.

Father Gregory Pumroy, MSW, ACSW
