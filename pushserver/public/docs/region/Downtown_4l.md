# La Vous New interior

La Vous New or "The New You" is a great first place to visit in Habitat. It's here that you can purchase the very thing that makes your avatar unique. You can purchase your very own head. That's right!

Let us introduce the Vendroid (or vendo as it later became known)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frandallfarmer/neohabitat-doc/master/docs/images/vendo.png "Vendroid")

Select **DO** to rotate the Vendroid to the next selection for sale.

Select **PUT** while holding tokens to purchase the item on display.

If you want to access your tokens, move the cursor over your avatars body and select **GET**. A screen will appear and you will see a sparkly blue coin. Move the cursor over it and select to get your tokens out of your pocket.

If you don't like this selection of heads, there are more available to your left.

There's also a handy pawn machine here incase you purchase a head you're not too keen on. You'll get a percentage of your tokens back but not the entire amount so choose your head carefully.

# Trivia

Every item in a vending machine can have a unique price to enable "local market efficiency" - and most items could be sold-back (at a markdown) in Pawn Machines (which originally used a fixed price list by object class.) During the original Habitat Beta test in 1986, this custom pricing lead to some interesting problems, recorded in  [The Lessons of Habitat](http://www.fudco.com/chip/lessons.html) scroll to "A Warning."
