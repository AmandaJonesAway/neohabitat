# La Vous New

La Vous New or "The New You" is a great first place to visit in Habitat. It's here that you can purchase the very thing that makes your avatar unique. You can purchase your very own head. That's right!

Due to the limitations of the technology at the time, memory was expensive and space was at a premium. Heads were a great way to get around this issue and allow you to have an instantly recognisable avatar.

They also became a valuable and sought after item. Certain heads could only be bought from certain places, or by participating in special events.

If this is your first time in NeoHabitat, we recommend heading through the door to check out the selection. Make sure you have your tokens at the ready!

If you need a refresher on how to pass through the door, here it is.

1. Place your cursor onto the door in the center of the wall. It doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to be on the door.

2. Skip to step 3 if the door is open. Otherwise you need to open it: press the trigger, and pull stick downward to select **DO**. By doing this your avatar will walk to the door and open it.

3. Now, make sure your cursor is placed on the open (dark) area of the door. Then, press the trigger, and push stick upward select **GO**.

The new rich class now began to distribute their wealth by having treasure hunts. There were other quests and hunts that gave many users fat bank accounts. Soon a true economy began to emerge: Heads. Since you can change heads in Habitat, and unique heads were often prizes or gifts from the oracle or very expensive, their value skyrocketed.

This would definitely be true when thousands of users came along, as there are only 200 or so styles of heads, and each user is initially given a choice from about 30 of those. Heads are the only obvious form of customization an Avatar has.

# Trivia

Every world that Randy and Chip later went on to create featured a New You area for changing their appearance.
