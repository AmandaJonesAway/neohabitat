# You are in someone's Turf.

Avatars all are created with a personal home, called a *Turf*. If you don't know where your turf is, just activate a teleport and enter the address **HOME**.

You may find you can't **PUT** or **GET** into/from the containers in other persons turf. This is a security measure. You could always leave a note on the floor.

The Party was one of my favorite activities. I liked to throw them at new Avatars' houses. I would ESP a known "Passive" Avatar, and ask him where he lived. If he told me, I would send ESP to "Actives" and "Motivators" that were on-line teleport to the address. Great fun.

A close cousin to parties was the Sleep-Over. The users invented this on their own. Often private discussions would take place in a turf. It was considered a minor social honor to be invited to sleep-over. This meant to log-out while still in another's turf. This was an honor because you would be able to log in later even if the host was not on. This would leave the host's belongings open to plunder.
