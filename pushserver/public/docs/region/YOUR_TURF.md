# Turf, Sweet Turf

This is your turf in Habitat, in other words this is your home. You can decorate your turf with items, throw parties, conduct meetings, etc.

The furniture built into this Turf and any contents may only be handled by you, the owner. But if you leave anything on the ground here, other visitors may walk in and carry it away.

# Decorating Your Turf
This information was taken from the official [Avatar Handbook](https://frandallfarmer.github.io/neohabitat-doc/docs/Avatar%20Handbook.html#CHAP4).
>You can get a device called a ‘‘Change-O-Matic’’ that will let you choose the color and pattern of the things in your Turf. To use it, hold it in your hands, point at the item you wish to change, and choose DO. The thing you have pointed at will change. By doing this several times in a row you can cycle through all the various choices of color and style. As with the body-sprayer, the Change-O-Matic can be purchased at the General Store or you can borrow somebody else’s. Unless you have been chosen by the Oracle as a highly trustworthy person of impeccable taste, a Change-O-Matic will only work for you inside your own Turf.

>Your Turf will come with some furniture, leaving it up to you to make just the right touches in decor. Maybe you’ll find them in the form of artifacts you bring back from your adventures. Perhaps you’ll have to go out and buy them. The Stuff Limit applies in the home Turf as well as anywhere else — don’t be extravagant, and don’t try to crowd too many objects into one area. No one will be impressed, and it will limit the number of people you can entertain.

# Extra Info
If your Avatar ever dies in Habitat then you will be promptly teleported back to your turf with your health restored.

Instead of walking all the way back home just use a TelePort booth instead. Insert the required amount of tokens into the booth, place your cursor over the booth, and type "home" for a quick travel.

The Party was one of my favorite activities. I liked to throw them at new Avatars' houses. I would ESP a known "Passive" Avatar, and ask him where he lived. If he told me, I would send ESP to "Actives" and "Motivators" that were on-line teleport to the address. Great fun.

A close cousin to parties was the Sleep-Over. The users invented this on their own. Often private discussions would take place in a turf. It was considered a minor social honor to be invited to sleep-over. This meant to log-out while still in another's turf. This was an honor because you would be able to log in later even if the host was not on. This would leave the host's belongings open to plunder.
