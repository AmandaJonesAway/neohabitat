# **Back room** Unauthorized Entry

It seems you have stumbled into the *back rooms* of the NeoHabitat project. These 'testing' regions were the first to come online as part of the Habitat restoration project, later known as the NeoHabitat project. 

This region came online in early 2017 and contained (at least the last time this database was reset) many objects you might not find easily in the rest of the world.

**Touch anything at your own peril.** There were items placed here that can kill your avatar, or maybe worse. Of course, if you don't find many things, that means they were plundered by earlier raiders.
