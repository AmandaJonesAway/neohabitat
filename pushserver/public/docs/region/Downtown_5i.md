# Populopolis Hall of Records

Avatars pride themselves at being the best. Because of that drive, they established a *Hall of Records* in which categories of distinction are as diverse as the activities they participate in.

Included here is a list of some of the *Guilderness Book of Records* title holders, with their record-making facts and figures.
