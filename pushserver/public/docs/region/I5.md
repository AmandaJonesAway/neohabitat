# I/5

This is the I/5 which leads out of town and takes you to the Back 40, the Beach and the Desert! To get back to town, just keep heading right!

The plan was that the I/5 would connect up to other areas in Habitat, complete with their own downtown areas and facilities. This never came to fruition and Populopolis was the only city built for Habitat, although one named Quantumgrad was in the works!

If you head right to the very end of the I/5, you can see the construction zone where this expansion would've taken place.

We wanted to have a map because we thought we would need a plan for enlarging the world as the user population grew. The idea was to have a framework into which we could plug new population centers and new places for stories and adventures.

We had all kinds of plans for what to do with this, which obviously we never had a chance to follow through on. One of my favorites was the notion that if you walked along the top (west) wall enough, eventually you’d find a door, and if you went through this door you’d find yourself in a control room of some kind, with all kinds of control panels and switches and whatnot.

What these switches would do would not be obvious, but in fact they’d control things like the lights and the day/night cycle in different parts of the world, the color palette in various places, the prices of things, etc. Also, each of the cities had a little backstory that explained its name and what kinds of things you might expect to find there.
