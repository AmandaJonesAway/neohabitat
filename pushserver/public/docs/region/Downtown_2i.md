# Machuta's Magic!

This region sells special magical items with unique functions. Some of these items were even used for dueling or causing mischief.

# Magic Inflation
Aside from economic inflation, Habitat once suffered from a very "magical" type of inflation.

Besides economic inflation, we also had Magic inflation. In the Dungeon of Death, the designer had a vending machine that sold magic wand that teleport to the oracle anyone you point them at for only 1000t. At this time magic wands worked forever. Soon everyone had one of these wands and people were zapping each other all over the place. Crime got really out of hand when criminals would travel as ghosts, wait for people to put their belongings down for a second, de-ghost - zap - and steal. I had always planned on implementing a limited "charges" feature but was to busy tracking down bugs. Soon it was clear it was time to act. "God" changed the rules, and limited magic. The issue became foremost in the discussion arena: Some people were using these rods for the "good" cause of rescuing people when they got lost. Many were outraged that the rules changed. Ask yourself this question: What would you have done? This is a tricky question, fundamental for the chief operator to understand.

# Duels

There are different kinds of wands within Habitat, but one of them ended up being used for a very unique purpose, which was dueling.

One of the wands we implemented caused the victim to perform the "jump" gesture, accompanied by a "Hah!" word balloon. It was fun for a while, mostly because you could really effect another Avatar, but it got old fast. Soon a game was developed completely by the users involving these wands: The Duel. The rules were simple: two combatants, two wands, one judge. When the judge says "go" the first to "hit" the other with the wand 3 times wins. Not as easy as it sounds, since the duelists are allowed to run around.
