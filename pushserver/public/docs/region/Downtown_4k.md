# The Pawn Machine

Pawn machines acted as the primary way for Avatars to recycle objects for __Tokens__ (Habitat's in-game currency). These simple machines ended up played a large role in "The Big-Money Scam."

During the Alpha test, "The Big Doll-Crystal Ball Scam" took place. In order to make the automated economy interesting, we made Vendroids so that the could have any price for any item. This was so we could have local, specialized economies (i.e. a widget could cost a little less if you bought it at Jack's Place instead of The Emporium). In two vending machines across town from each other were two items that were for sale for less than the pawn machine would buy them back for: Dolls (for sale at 75t, hock at 100t) and Crystal Balls (for sale at 18000t, hock at 30000t). One weekend several persons participated in the Scam, they took their money, purchased many boxes, walked to the Doll Vendroid and bought as many as they could afford, walked back to town and pawned them. They repeated this process until they had enough to purchase Crystal Balls. This took many hours. The final result was at least 3 people with 100,000t - 500,000t. In one night the economy had been diluted as the T1 (the Token Supply) has jumped 5 times!

# What the Wealthy did
The Big-Money Scam ended up having a positive impact on Habitat's economy. The newly enriched Avatars began to distribute their wealth and special Heads skyrocketed in value.

The new rich class now began to distribute their wealth by having treasure hunts. There were other quests and hunts that gave many users fat bank accounts. Soon a true economy began to emerge: Heads. Since you can change heads in Habitat, and unique heads were often prizes or gifts from the oracle or very expensive, their value skyrocketed. This would definitely be true when thousands of users came along, as there are only 200 or so styles of heads, and each user is initially given a choice from about 30 of those. Heads are the only obvious form of customization an Avatar has.
