# The Money Tree

The Money Tree was implemented by Randy Farmer and was intended to be a starter quest. Something to get avatars talking amongst each other and give them a headstart in the world.

It gives you a one time only free gift of 100 tokens if you issue a DO command on the base of the tree.

It was quite infamous in the original Habitat world.

You can view video footage of the original Money Tree in action from the Summer of 1988 by Keith Elkin by clicking [here](https://youtu.be/KTtIzLZGNLw?t=3715)
